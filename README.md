P.S.i is a musical and conceptual project released in 2015 by the Multidisciplinary Artist from Costa Rican and Panamá. P.S.i is related with the mind, the psy is related with the psiquis, from the greek. Also, is related with the psi bars, associated with the pressure in a vacuum system. Also is related with the infinite process to deploy and integrate, as Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment CI/CD more related wit pipelines and software processes. :P
